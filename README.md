# ExecBot
### Arbitrary code execution for fun

listen I cannot emphisize enough how much you should not run this telegram bot. There is 
nothing stopping somebody from happening across your bot's account while it's running and
doing anything to your laptop and any files on it. 

That said, if you want to give your friends access to your machine for a "twitch plays
terminal" sort of experience, this is your bot. 

### Again, I cannot advise running this, even on a VM.
